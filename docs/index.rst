sphinx-sharedconf
=================

Share a single ``conf.py`` file between several Sphinx projects,
useful if you want to import several projects from the same
repository on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__.

.. warning::

   If you aren't using Read the Docs to build your documentation,
   you probably don't need this extension,
   see :ref:`advanced-usage:sharing a conf.py file without using an extension`.
