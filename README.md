Build multiple Sphinx projects from a single repository on
[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org).

**If you aren't using Read the Docs to build your documentation,
you probably don't need this extension,
read [this](https://sphinx-sharedconf.readthedocs.io/page/advanced-usage.html#sharing-a-conf-py-file-without-using-an-extension)**.
